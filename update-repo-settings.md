# Update GitHub Repository Settings

Since GitHub CLI is not installed, please update these settings manually on GitHub:

## 1. Repository Description

Go to: https://github.com/walloutlet/LibreNMS-Alert-Templates

Click the **⚙️ gear icon** next to "About" and add this description:

```
Professional HTML email alert templates for LibreNMS network monitoring. Features color-coded notifications, detailed device info, and actionable troubleshooting guidance for device outages, latency, port status, bandwidth utilization, and storage alerts.
```

## 2. Add Topics (Tags)

In the same "About" settings dialog, add these topics:

- librenms
- network-monitoring
- alert-templates
- html-email
- monitoring
- snmp
- network-alerts
- email-templates
- sysadmin
- devops

## 3. Verify License

GitHub should automatically detect "The Unlicense" - you should see it displayed in the sidebar.

If it doesn't appear automatically:
- Go to the repository main page
- Look for "Add a license" or the license section
- GitHub should detect it from the LICENSE file

---

All done! Your repository is now:
✅ Fully documented with README.md
✅ Licensed under The Unlicense (public domain)
✅ Includes all 10 alert templates
✅ Ready for public use
